        <li>3 pcs medium sized bitter gourd, seeded and sliced into large chunks</li>
        <li>1 big packet sinigang mix (tamarind mix)</li>
        <li>1 to 1.5 liters beef stock</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cane vinegar</li>
        <li>1 whole garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 thumb size ginger, crushed and sliced finely</li>
        <li>2 medium size red onion, chopped</li>
        <li>6 green finger chillies (siling haba)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>fish sauce</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>oil</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate liver for 30 minutes in vinegar then set aside.</li>
        <li>In a pot saut√© garlic, ginger and onion in oil.</li>
        <li>Add all meat ingredients except for the liver, stir fry for 1 and brown on all sides</li>
        <li>Add beef stock, bitter gourd and chillies (do not slice). Bring to a boil and simmer for 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the vinegar out of the liver.</li>
        <li>Remove the chunks of bitter gourd and place them on a blender, blend well.</li>
        <li>Place blended bitter gourd into a fine sieve or a muslin cloth, run some hot stock on top while draining directly on the pot, this will get the maximum bitterness of the bitter gourd while making the soup clear.</li>
        <li>Add sinigang mix and liver simmer for additional 10 minutes, you might need to reduce the amount of sinigang mix according to the sourness you like.</li>
        <li>Flavour with fish sauce (according to your taste) and season with freshly ground black pepper.</li>
    </ol><br>
